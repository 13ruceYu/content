# Writing content

The Content module parses `.md` and `.yaml` files inside `content` directory and provides paths according to the directory structure.

::alert{type='warning'}
The paths created by Nuxt Content are not proper routes reachable from a client. Components and Pages can [fetch them internally](/guide/fetching) to display content.
::

```[Directory structure]
content/
  getting-started/
    index.md    // '/getting-started/'
    installation.md     // '/getting-started/installation'
    writing.md      // '/getting-started/writing'
  index.md        // '/'
```

## Ordering

Add numeric prefix to files and directories inside `content` directory to give them in order.
Nuxt Content uses these numbers to order content lists.

> Separate number from file name using `.` character. Using any other separator will not work.

```[Directory structure]
content/
  1.frameworks/
    1.vue.md
    2.nuxt.md 
  2.examples/
    1.vercel.md
    2.netlify.md
    3.heroku.md
    index.md
```

## Ignoring

Content module will ignore dot files and folders from listing in content lists.
Adding `.` prefix to any file will make them to be ignored.

> Note: When a directory name starts with `.` all of its nested content will be ignored.

```[Directory structure]
content/
   1.frameworks/
    .1.vue.md              // Ignored content
    2.nuxt.md 
  .2.translation/          // Ignored directory
    1.fa/
      1.messages.md        // Ignored content because of its grand parent
    2.fr/
      1.messages.md        // Ignored content because of its grand parent
```

## Partials

Adding `_` prefix to files will mark them as partial contents.
Partial contents are accessible in search and content lists but are not displayed in content navigation.

> Note: When a directory name starts with `_` all of its nested contents will mark as partial.

```[Directory structure]
content/
   1.frameworks/
    _1.vue.md              // Partial content
    2.nuxt.md 
  _2.translation/          // Partial directory
    1.fa/
      1.messages.md        // Partial content because of its grand parent
    2.fr/
      1.messages.md        // Partial content because of its grand parent
```
