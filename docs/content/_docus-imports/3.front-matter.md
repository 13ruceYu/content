# Front-matter

Easily configure the rendering of your Markdown pages. 📝

---

Front-matter is used to transmit data to your components and templates, from any page or directory.

## Native parameters

Docus core and default theme includes a lot of native parameters that you can already use to configure your pages.

| Key | Type | Description |
|---------|--------| -----|
| **Page** | | |
| `title` | `String` | Title of the page (injected in page metas) |
| `description` | `String` | Description of the page (injected in page metas). |

## Shortcuts

The **title** and **description** are automatically filled in from the Markdown content:

```md
# Title of the page

Description of the page
```

You can overwrite them using the Front-matter:

```md
---
title: Overwritten title
description: Overwritten description
---

# Title of the page

Description of the page
```
