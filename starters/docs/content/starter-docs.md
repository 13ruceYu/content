This starter is a [Nuxt.js](https://nuxtjs.org) app using **@nuxtjs/content**. It allows to quickly start writing a technical documentation for any kind of project.

Want a showcase? You're looking at it!

Inspired by [docc](https://github.com/mrcrmn/docc).

## Usage

The easiest way to use this starter is to download directly the subdirectory of the Github repository.

You can do so with `degit`:

```bash
npx degit https://github.com/nuxt-company/content-module/tree/master/starters/docs docs
```

Go into the created folder and install it:

```base
cd docs
yarn
```

Start the Nuxt.js app:

```bash
yarn dev
```

You can then start writing in the `content` folder, you have nothing to configure.

## Features

### Sidebar

The sidebar is automatically generated by calling `$content().sortBy('position')` to list files in root directory, sorted by position and grouped by category.

To use this system, you need to add `position` and `category` to your content files.

### Next and Previous Navigation

If you scroll to the bottom of the page, you will notice some links to the previous and next pages of these docs.

These links are automatically generated from calling the `surround` method:

```js
const [prev, next] = await $content()
  .fields(['title', 'slug'])
  .sortBy('position', 'asc')
  .surround(slug, { before: 1, after: 1 })
  .fetch()
```

### Table of contents

On the right side of the page is an overview of every headline (h2, h3) of the current viewed page.

This list is returned in the `toc` property by the API when fetching a single document.

```js
const { title, body, toc } = await $content(params.slug).fetch()
```

### Search

In the navbar, you can search for files in your content directory. The full-text search is performed on `title`, `slug` and `body` by default.

```js
this.results = await this.$content().sortBy('position', 'asc').limit(12).search(q).fetch()
```

### Dark mode

This starter implements dark mode, thanks to [color-mode-module](https://github.com/nuxt-community/color-mode-module). Click the icon at the top of the page and try it out for yourself!

### TailwindCSS

This starter uses [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), thanks to [tailwindcss-module](https://github.com/nuxt-community/tailwindcss-module).

You can easily configure it by editing the tailwind.config.js file. [PurgeCSS](https://purgecss.com/) is included as well by the module to keep the bundle size as low as possible and the website fast and snappy!

## Make it your own

This starter is just a two-page simple Nuxt.js app, you can easily start building on it.

Don't like how something was designed or implemented? Just change the code and make it your way.
